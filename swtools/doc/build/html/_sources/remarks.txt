Remarks
=======

Swarm Level0 data products *can* be read, but tools for this have been stored elsewhere as it is less flexible, and builds mainly upon the work of Stefano Mattia, and uses a different framework. To get this, or if there are other questions related to `swtools`, you can contact Mikael Toresen mikaelt@esa.int.

A demo of some of the functionality may be found under the `demo` folder.
