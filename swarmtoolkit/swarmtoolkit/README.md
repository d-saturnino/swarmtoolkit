swarmtoolkit is a toolbox intended to provide simple and quick access to the Swarm L1 and L2 products for Python3.

This packages is *not* intended as a replacement for Spacepy's `pycdf`. In fact, this package requires installation of pycdf, and to read Swarm products stored as CDF, swarmtoolkit provides a wrapper for pycdf to extract the parameters contained and store them as numpy arrays.

For information about `swarmtoolkit` see the documentation under 
`doc/swarmtoolkit_doc.pdf`

A ipython notebook demo can be found in `demo/swarmtoolkit_demo.ipynb`, and
a pdf version can be found in `doc/swarmtoolkit_demo.pdf`
